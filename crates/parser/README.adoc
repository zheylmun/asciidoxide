= asciidoxide parser

High performance https://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc] lexer and parser library written in safe Rust.
The project aims to provide a zero-copy, spec-compliant AsciiDoc parser.
The library uses https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky[chumsky] for lexing and parsing.
No additional features beyond lexing and parsing are planned for this crate.

== Building

[source,bash]
----
cargo build
----

== Testing

This project has two test suites:

. *Rust test suite* -- Unit tests and integration tests using local TCK fixtures
. *TCK harness validation* -- Integration with the official Eclipse AsciiDoc TCK harness

=== Rust Test Suite

The Rust test suite includes unit tests for the lexer, parser, and span utilities, plus integration tests that validate parser output against TCK fixture files.

[source,bash]
----
# Run all tests (unit + integration)
cargo test

# Run only unit tests (faster)
cargo test --lib

# Run a specific test by name
cargo test doc_single_paragraph

# Run tests with output shown
cargo test -- --nocapture
----

The integration tests in `tests/tck.rs` load fixture pairs from `language_repositories/asciidoc_tck/tests/` and compare the parser's ASG output against expected JSON.
Features not yet implemented are listed in the `UNSUPPORTED` array and skipped during testing.

=== TCK Harness Validation (Eclipse Foundation)

The https://github.com/asciidoc/asciidoc-tck[AsciiDoc Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)] is an official test suite maintained by the Eclipse Foundation to verify parser compliance with the AsciiDoc Language specification.

This project includes integration with the TCK's Node.js harness, which invokes our parser as an external adapter and validates output against the official fixtures.

==== Prerequisites

. *Node.js 18+* -- Required to run the TCK harness
+
[source,bash]
----
node --version  # Should be v18.0.0 or higher
----

. *Initialize git submodules* -- The TCK and language spec are git submodules
+
[source,bash]
----
git submodule update --init --recursive
----

. *Install TCK dependencies*
+
[source,bash]
----
cd language_repositories/asciidoc_tck
npm ci
cd ../..
----

==== Running the TCK Harness

[source,bash]
----
cargo test --test tck_harness
----

This command:

. Builds the test binary which can act as a TCK adapter
. Invokes the official Node.js TCK harness (`harness/bin/asciidoc-tck.js`)
. The harness calls back into the test binary for each fixture
. Results are displayed showing which tests pass or fail

==== Interpreting Results

The TCK harness output shows a tree of test results:

----
tests
  inline
    span
      strong
        constrained single word (4ms)
        unconstrained (4ms)
      strong (50ms)
    span (200ms)
  block
    paragraph
      single line (4ms)
    section
      section with style (4ms)  # Parser doesn't support this yet
----

Failed tests indicate features the parser hasn't implemented yet.
The Rust test suite's `UNSUPPORTED` list tracks these gaps.

==== Manual Adapter Testing

You can also test the adapter protocol directly:

[source,bash]
----
# Build the test binary
cargo test --test tck_harness --no-run

# Find the binary path (shown in cargo output)
# Then test it manually:
echo '{"contents":"*bold*","path":"test","type":"inline"}' | \
  TCK_ADAPTER_MODE=1 ./target/debug/deps/tck_harness-*

== Acknowledgments

This project would not be possible without the work of the AsciiDoc community:

* https://github.com/asciidoc/asciidoc-lang[AsciiDoc Language Specification] -- The official language specification maintained by the Eclipse Foundation. This project aims to be a compliant implementation of this spec.
* https://github.com/asciidoc/asciidoc-tck[AsciiDoc Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)] -- The official test suite for verifying parser compliance. Used extensively to validate this parser's output.
* https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor[Asciidoctor] -- The reference AsciiDoc processor. Its comprehensive test suite and documentation have been invaluable for understanding AsciiDoc semantics.

Thank you to all the contributors to these projects for making AsciiDoc an awesome, open, well-specified document format.
